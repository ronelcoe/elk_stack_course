################### Heartbeat Configuration Example #########################

# This file is a full configuration example documenting all non-deprecated
# options in comments. For a shorter configuration example, that contains
# only some common options, please see heartbeat.yml in the same directory.
#
# You can find the full configuration reference here:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/heartbeat/index.html

############################# Heartbeat ######################################


# Define a directory to load monitor definitions from. Definitions take the form
# of individual yaml files.
heartbeat.config.monitors:
  # Directory + glob pattern to search for configuration files
  path: /data/elk/heartbeat/config/*.yml
  # If enabled, heartbeat will periodically check the config.monitors path for changes
  reload.enabled: true
  # How often to check for changes
  reload.period: 10s

  # ---------------------------- Elasticsearch Output ----------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
  # Boolean flag to enable or disable the output module.
  #enabled: true

  # Array of hosts to connect to.
  # Scheme and port can be left out and will be set to the default (http and 9200)
  # In case you specify and additional path, the scheme is required: http://localhost:9200/path
  # IPv6 addresses should always be defined as: https://[2001:db8::1]:9200
  hosts: ["http://elasticsearch:9200"]

# ============================= X-Pack Monitoring ==============================
# Heartbeat can export internal metrics to a central Elasticsearch monitoring
# cluster.  This requires xpack monitoring to be enabled in Elasticsearch.  The
# reporting is disabled by default.

# Set to true to enable the monitoring reporter.
monitoring.enabled: true

# Sets the UUID of the Elasticsearch cluster under which monitoring data for this
# Heartbeat instance will appear in the Stack Monitoring UI. If output.elasticsearch
# is enabled, the UUID is derived from the Elasticsearch cluster referenced by output.elasticsearch.
#monitoring.cluster_uuid:

# Uncomment to send the metrics to Elasticsearch. Most settings from the
# Elasticsearch output are accepted here as well.
# Note that the settings should point to your Elasticsearch *monitoring* cluster.
# Any setting that is not set is automatically inherited from the Elasticsearch
# output configuration, so if you have the Elasticsearch output configured such
# that it is pointing to your Elasticsearch monitoring cluster, you can simply
# uncomment the following line.
monitoring.elasticsearch:

  # Array of hosts to connect to.
  # Scheme and port can be left out and will be set to the default (http and 9200)
  # In case you specify and additional path, the scheme is required: http://localhost:9200/path
  # IPv6 addresses should always be defined as: https://[2001:db8::1]:9200
