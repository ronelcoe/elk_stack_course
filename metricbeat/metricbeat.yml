########################## Metricbeat Configuration ###########################

# This file is a full configuration example documenting all non-deprecated
# options in comments. For a shorter configuration example, that contains only
# the most common options, please see metricbeat.yml in the same directory.
#
# You can find the full configuration reference here:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/index.html

#============================  Config Reloading ===============================

# Config reloading allows to dynamically load modules. Each file which is
# monitored must contain one or multiple modules as a list.
metricbeat.config.modules:

  # Glob pattern for configuration reloading
  path: /data/elk/metricbeat/modules.d/*.yml

  # Period on which files under path should be checked for changes
  reload.period: 10s

  # Set to true to enable config reloading
  reload.enabled: true

# Maximum amount of time to randomly delay the start of a metricset. Use 0 to
# disable startup delay.
metricbeat.max_start_delay: 10s

# ================================= Dashboards =================================

# These settings control loading the sample dashboards to the Kibana index. Loading
# the dashboards are disabled by default and can be enabled either by setting the
# options here, or by using the `-setup` CLI flag or the `setup` command.
# setup.dashboards.enabled: false

# The directory from where to read the dashboards. The default is the `kibana`
# folder in the home path.
#setup.dashboards.directory: ${path.home}/kibana

# The URL from where to download the dashboards archive. It is used instead of
# the directory if it has a value.
# setup.dashboards.url: "http://kibana:5601"

# The file archive (zip file) from where to read the dashboards. It is used instead
# of the directory when it has a value.
#setup.dashboards.file:

# In case the archive contains the dashboards from multiple Beats, this lets you
# select which one to load. You can load all the dashboards in the archive by
# setting this to the empty string.
# setup.dashboards.beat: metricbeat

# The name of the Kibana index to use for setting the configuration. Default is ".kibana"
# setup.dashboards.kibana_index: .kibana

# The Elasticsearch index name. This overwrites the index name defined in the
# dashboards and index pattern. Example: testbeat-*
#setup.dashboards.index:

# Always use the Kibana API for loading the dashboards instead of autodetecting
# how to install the dashboards by first querying Elasticsearch.
# setup.dashboards.always_kibana: true

# If true and Kibana is not reachable at the time when dashboards are loaded,
# it will retry to reconnect to Kibana instead of exiting with an error.
#setup.dashboards.retry.enabled: false

# Duration interval between Kibana connection retries.
# setup.dashboards.retry.interval: 5s

# Maximum number of retries before exiting with an error, 0 for unlimited retrying.
#setup.dashboards.retry.maximum: 0

# ---------------------------- Elasticsearch Output ----------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
  # Boolean flag to enable or disable the output module.
  #enabled: true

  # Array of hosts to connect to.
  # Scheme and port can be left out and will be set to the default (http and 9200)
  # In case you specify and additional path, the scheme is required: http://localhost:9200/path
  # IPv6 addresses should always be defined as: https://[2001:db8::1]:9200
  hosts: ["http://elasticsearch:9200"]

# ============================= X-Pack Monitoring ==============================
# Metricbeat can export internal metrics to a central Elasticsearch monitoring
# cluster.  This requires xpack monitoring to be enabled in Elasticsearch.  The
# reporting is disabled by default.

# Set to true to enable the monitoring reporter.
monitoring.enabled: true

# Sets the UUID of the Elasticsearch cluster under which monitoring data for this
# Metricbeat instance will appear in the Stack Monitoring UI. If output.elasticsearch
# is enabled, the UUID is derived from the Elasticsearch cluster referenced by output.elasticsearch.
#monitoring.cluster_uuid:

# Uncomment to send the metrics to Elasticsearch. Most settings from the
# Elasticsearch output are accepted here as well.
# Note that the settings should point to your Elasticsearch *monitoring* cluster.
# Any setting that is not set is automatically inherited from the Elasticsearch
# output configuration, so if you have the Elasticsearch output configured such
# that it is pointing to your Elasticsearch monitoring cluster, you can simply
# uncomment the following line.
monitoring.elasticsearch:

  # Array of hosts to connect to.
  # Scheme and port can be left out and will be set to the default (http and 9200)
  # In case you specify and additional path, the scheme is required: http://localhost:9200/path
  # IPv6 addresses should always be defined as: https://[2001:db8::1]:9200
  hosts: ["http://elasticsearch:9200"]
